# Introduction 
I have chosen to look at Premier Lacrosse League scoring data over the past three years in regular season, and post season play for the eight teams that are apart of the PLL orginization. Thoughout this analysis I was able to visualize how imoactful it is on teasm that are more successful in the leage and their scoring trends over the past three years. The goal of this project was to visualize the scoring trends of all eight teams and identify the trends of the teams who have been more successful in the post season play.
